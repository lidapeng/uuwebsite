			  <p align="justified" style="line-height:25px"><FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><font size = "3">I was born in Weihai, a small city on the east coast of Shandong      
				Province, China. I went to Beijing to attend college in 2004 and lived there for seven years. I spent four years in college and earned my Bachelor's degree from     
				<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cugb.edu.cn/EnglishWeb/index.html"> <em>China University of Geosciences (Beijing)</em></a>,       
				 a geology school that has cultivated a great many geologists in China. As an undergraduate, I majored in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the <a href="http://iec.cugb.edu.cn/xgweb/Showindex" target="_blank">School of Information Engineering</a> and was        
				trained as a software engineer via the four-year undergraduate program. After college graduation, I enrolled in        
				the Masters program of Cartography and Geographic Information Systems at the Institute of Remote Sensing and GIS,     
				<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/"> <em>Peking University</em></a>. After I got my Masters degree,&nbsp; I came to Utah to pursue my PhD in the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geog.utah.edu/">Department of Geography</a> at the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.utah.edu/"> <em>University of Utah</em></a> 
				 in August, 2011. </font></p>
				<p align="justified" style="line-height: 25px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT size="3">My undergraduate study mainly focused on software engineering. With my engineering        
				background, I worked as a research assistant for Dr. <a href="http://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/Faculty-by-Dept/128.htm"> Chengqi Cheng </a> at the Institute of Remote        
				Sensing and GIS at Peking University.&nbsp; I started to conduct research on Location-Based       
				 Services (LBS) and developed interest in this field. In 2008, an        
				earthquake hit Sichuan Province, China and caused many deaths. Because I was shocked by first responders' unpreparedness for that earthquake,   
				 I started to pay attention to geospatial technologies in emergency management.  I believe that geospatial technologies can make a difference if we make better use of them in disasters. <br /></FONT></p><p align="justified" style="line-height: 25px;"><FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the University of Utah, I worked with Dr. <a href="http://geog.utah.edu/people/8-tom-cova.html">Tom Cova</a> (primary adviser) and <a href="http://www.geog.utah.edu/people/9-philip-dennison.html">Phil Dennison</a> </FONT><FONT size="3">(co-adviser)</FONT><FONT size="3"> on an National Science Foundation (NSF) project named &quot;protective action triggers&quot; (2011-2014), which aims to improve our understanding of evacuation timing and protectve action selection in wildfire evacuations. My dissertation focuses on wildfire          
				evacuation modeling, which involves using fire spread modeling, traffic          
				simulation, and GIS to model wildfire evacuation as a coupled human-environment system. <br /></FONT></p><p align="justified" style="line-height: 25px;"><FONT size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the fourth year (2014-2015), I worked as a research assistant for Dr. <a href="http://www.geog.utah.edu/people/123-neng-wan.html">Neng Wan</a>. My research focused on using smartphone accelerometers to study physical activity. My previous experience in mobile computing concentrated on mobile development and information systems, and this new field helped me sharpen my skills in mobile computing and develop a good understanding of its applications in public health.&nbsp;</FONT></p><p align="justified" style="line-height: 25px;"><FONT size="3">&nbsp; &nbsp; In this fall, I am working as a research assistant for Dr. <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0916912-QUYNH_CAMTHI_NGUYEN/biography/index.hml">Quynh Nguyen </a>on an NIH project that aims to use social media in public health applications. My responsibilities include spatial data processing and geovisualization. At the same time, I am also working on the last manuscript in my dissertation and trying to finish up my dissertation during the fall semester. <br /></FONT></p><p align="justified" style="line-height: 25px;"><FONT size="3"><br /></FONT></p></form>
